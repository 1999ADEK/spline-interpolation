# spline-interpolation
This project discusses how we can use spline interpolation to outline an object of interest.
* In [plotting-a-contour](jupyter-notebooks/plotting-a-contour.ipynb), we introduce the basic idea of cubic interpolation and compare the plotting results via shape-preserving interpolation and spline interpolation.
* In [spline-in-different-conditions](jupyter-notebooks/spline-in-different-conditions.ipynb), we further discuss how spline interpolation in three differnt conditions affects the plotting result.
* In [spline-surface](jupyter-notebooks/spline-surface.ipynb), we apply spline interpolation to bicubic polynomial to plot a surface in three-dimensional space.
